            <h3>Here's what happens at the Burger spot in the first 5 seasons</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Season 1 </strong>Bob almost gets shut down as Louise spreads the rumor that they serve human
                flesh. Bob wouldn't do that, would he?</li>
                <li><strong>Season 2 </strong>Linda babies her children too much. And they play her like a fiddle.</li>
                <li><strong>Season 3 </strong>The Belchers build lifelonig friendships with dangerous people and the
                adventures keeo coming.</li>
                <li><strong>Season 4 </strong>Tina's puberty is coming at her like a train. Of puberty.</li>
                <li><strong>Season 5 </strong>Bob has ground beef under his nails, but it should ground beef AND dirt.</li>
            </ul>

            <i>Bob has touched the lives and bellies of tens of customers throughout the years. His business would be
            somwhere completely different if it weren't for Linda, or as she says, "Burger Linda". Bob and his
            incredibly creative family are constantly pushing the limits of what is and isn't a burger.</i><br><br>
            <i>-- Truer words have never been spoken.</i>

        <h5>The Belchers are here to teach us about more than burgers. This is a show about life. And burgers. Life and burgers.
